Remove from the heat, leave to cool, then stir in the brandy, rum or sherry.   Preheat the oven to 200C\/400F\/Gas 6 (fan 180C) and grease a 23x33cm\/9x13in Swiss roll tin or equivalent. For the pastry, sift the flour and icing sugar into a mixing bowl and rub in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse breadcrumbs.  Add just sufficient cold water to mix to a firm dough - if you prefer this can be made in a processor.  If time allows, wrap the dough in cling film and chill for about 30 minutes.  On  a lightly floured work surface, roll out the pastry to a rectangle slightly larger than the prepared tin, then line the base and sides of the tin with pastry.   Trim the pastry level with the top edges of the tin and patch any gaps if necessary.   Spread the mincemeat evenly over the pastry base. To make the topping, melt the butter and allow this to cool slightly. Put the remaining ingredients into a bowl and pour the melted butter over. Mix together until the ingredients combine to form a dough. If time allows, chill this mixture - this makes grating easier. Using a coarse grater, grate the topping over the mincemeat and spread evenly. Bake in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes, or until golden-brown. Cut into 16 slices, dust with icing sugar and serve warm with cream or brandy butter.
