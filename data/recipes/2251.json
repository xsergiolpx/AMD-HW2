Leave extra cling film hanging over the sides. Bash the biscuits into pieces using a rolling pin. (Put them in a plastic bag first so they don't go everywhere!) Melt chocolate, butter and golden syrup in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water. Stir occasionally. Remove the bowl from the heat and stir in the broken biscuits, apricots, raisins and pecans (optional). Spoon the mixture into the tin. Level the surface by pressing it down with a potato masher. Leave to cool, then put the chocolate mixture in the fridge for 1-2 hours to set. Turn out the cake and peel off the cling film. Cut the cake into 12 squares and enjoy!
